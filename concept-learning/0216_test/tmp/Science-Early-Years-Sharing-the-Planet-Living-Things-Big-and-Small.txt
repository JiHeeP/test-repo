Lens: Humble-Crofts
Grade Level: Early Years (5-6 year olds) Duration: 6 weeks
Unit overview:
How do you know if something is living and what can you do to take care of living things? Who is responsible for
taking care of living things at home and in nature? In this unit we will looking at the differences between adult and
young animals, and the different ways babies tell their parents what they need. Together we will find out what a
scientist does and conduct our own scientific investigations!

Standards:
● All animals need food in order to live and grow. They obtain their food from plants or from other animals.
Plants need water and light to live and grow. (K-LS1-1)
● Plants and animals can change their environment. (K-ESS2-2)
● Living things need water, air, and resources from the land, and they live in places that have the things they
need. Humans use natural resources for everything they do. (K-ESS3-1)
● Things that people do to live comfortably can affect the world around them. But they can make choices that
reduce their impacts on the land, water, air, and other living things. (K-ESS3-3)
