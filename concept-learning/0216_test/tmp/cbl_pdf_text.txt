Abstract
This paper examines the characteristics of concept-based curriculum and instruction models and
identifies the International Baccalaureate (IB) programmes as a three-dimensional, concept-based
model. A discussion of the benefits of concept-based instruction supports the majority of attributes in
the IB learner profile. Concept-based instruction requires an understanding of synergistic thinking,
transfer of knowledge and social construction of knowledge. This paper addresses these areas and
discusses them in the context of the required IB pedagogy. It concludes with a review of the challenges
in implementing a concept-based model and a summary of the rewards.
Introduction
The International Baccalaureate programmes offer a design for curriculum and instruction that is more
challenging than traditional models, but which can produce deeper intellectual and emotional
engagement in learning. The concept-based design is fully supported by cognitive and learning
research. When information today is a click away on a computer keyboard, the use of classroom time
must shift focus from covering and memorizing information to thinking with and applying knowledge at
both the factual and conceptual levels. Thinking deeply with factual knowledge and concepts to
communicate ideas and solve problems, transferring knowledge across distinct global contexts and
situations, and seeing patterns and connections between concepts, ideas and situations are at the heart
of concept-based teaching and learning. Less factual coverage can open the door to deeper thinking
and understanding.
What is concept-based curriculum and
instruction?
Concept-based curriculum and instruction is a three-dimensional design model that frames factual
content and skills with disciplinary concepts, generalizations and principles. Concept-based curriculum
is contrasted with the traditional two-dimensional model of topic-based curriculum which focuses on
factual content and skills with assumed rather than deliberate attention to the development of
conceptual understanding and the transfer of knowledge (see Figure 1).

Erickson 2008).
Two-dimensional curriculum models focus on facts and skills with the goals of content coverage,
analysis and the memorization of information. Three-dimensional models focus on concepts, principles
and generalizations, using related facts and skills as tools to gain deeper understanding of disciplinary
content, transdisciplinary themes and interdisciplinary issues, and to facilitate conceptual transfer
through time, across cultures and across situations. Three-dimensional models value a solid base of
critical factual knowledge across the disciplines, but they raise the bar for curriculum and instruction by
shifting the design focus to the conceptual level of understanding. This focus necessarily requires a
supporting role for factual knowledge.
A corollary goal of concept-based instruction that is seldom stated overtly is development of the
intellect. In a concept-based instruction model teachers use the facts in concert with concepts and
generalizations to effect higher order, synergistic thinking. Facts provide the foundation and support for
deeper, conceptual thinking and understanding. Three-dimensional concept-based curriculum models
value student inquiry and constructivist learning to support personal meaning-making.
The research and agreement on the importance of conceptual understanding is undeniable. From the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) (2009) we hear the call:
Any national mathematics curriculum must emphasize depth over breadth and must focus
on the essential ideas and processes of mathematics (p 1).
…research on the learning of complex subjects such as mathematics has
solidly established the important role of conceptual understanding in the
knowledge and activity of persons who are proficient (p 2).
One of the strongest research summaries supporting the importance of conceptual understanding can
be found in How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience and School (Bransford et al 2000), published
by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council.
Experts’ knowledge is connected and organized around important concepts
(eg, Newton’s second law of motion) (p 9).
To develop competence in an area of inquiry, students must: a) have a deep
foundation of factual knowledge, b) understand facts and ideas in the
context of a conceptual framework, and c) organize knowledge in ways that
facilitate retrieval and application (p 16).
Concept-based teaching and learning 4

## PAGE 5
… organizing information into a conceptual framework allows for greater
transfer; that is, it allows the student to apply what was learned in new
situations and to learn related information more quickly (p 17).
Anderson and Krathwohl’s book (2001) updated Benjamin Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational
Objectives (1956), and further supports the need to teach for deeper conceptual understanding.
By separating factual knowledge from conceptual knowledge, we highlight
the need for educators to teach for deep understanding of conceptual
knowledge, not just for remembering isolated and small bits of factual
knowledge (p 42).
Students understand when they build connections between the “new”
knowledge to be gained and their prior knowledge. More specifically, the
incoming knowledge is integrated with existing schemas and cognitive
frameworks. Since concepts are the building blocks for these schemas and
frameworks, conceptual knowledge provides a basis for understanding
(p 70).
Beyond the research, the importance of conceptual structures for disciplinary content just makes logical
sense.
In what ways are IB programmes concept-
based?
The Primary Years Programme (PYP), Middle Years Programme (MYP) and Diploma Programme (DP)
are three-dimensional and concept-based because, by deliberate design, they require students to
process factual knowledge through the conceptual level of thinking.
The DP values deeper critical thinking and conceptual understanding. The required theory of knowledge
course examines different ways of knowing and challenges students to think beyond the facts as they
analyse complex questions and issues in interdisciplinary inquiries. The extended essay and a variety
of internal assessment tasks also engage the critical thinking of students as they independently plan,
research, write and defend a significant question drawn from one of the subject areas (IB 2009b).
DP teachers ensure that students know the attributes and meaning of the subject area concepts. At
times, however, teachers express a concern over the tension between a heavy curriculum load and the
time to teach for deeper conceptual understanding and the transfer of knowledge. This tension can
sometimes result in implicit rather than explicit demonstrations of understanding. As the DP continues
to develop, this tension might ease if key concepts and disciplinary related concepts were used to
explicitly state the important conceptual relationships to guide instruction. This would focus the teaching
and learning on the most significant conceptual understandings, and strengthen the bridge between the
PYP, MYP and DP. I am sensitive to the curricular demands for university recognition but I also feel
strongly that less is more when the student synergistically processes factual information through the
conceptual level of thinking. Building the conceptual structures for deep understanding and the transfer
of knowledge supports autonomous learners who maximize their learning by seeing patterns and
connections between new knowledge and prior learning. New courses based on conceptual frameworks
such as global politics will continue to emerge that will support teachers in helping students learn to do
meta-analyses of complex systems, but traditional discipline-based courses also need a concept-based
curriculum and instruction design for deep understanding.
The DP, like the PYP and MYP, supports international-mindedness and understanding of other cultures.
Identifying key and related concepts and framing critical subject area content with a central idea and
additional “supporting ideas” (which will be introduced later in this paper) can strengthen the transfer of
knowledge across global contexts as new examples of previously learned concepts arise. Concept-
based curriculums can support teachers in moving deliberately to idea-centred instruction. I know that
DP teachers value deeper conceptual thinking and understanding. An idea-centred curriculum of
important conceptual understandings supported by relevant content would help teachers meet these
goals.
Concept-based teaching and learning 5

## PAGE 6
The PYP is transdisciplinary in nature. The identification of transdisciplinary themes (for example, who
we are, how the world works) frame the concepts, skills, attitudes and actions linked to what is real and
relevant in the world through the design of programmes of inquiry. The transdisciplinary themes ensure
that curriculum and instruction move beyond factual coverage in discrete subject areas to an integrative
synthesis of knowledge and conceptual understandings to better understand our world and our place
within the world (IB 2010). The MYP is developing a set of “global contexts” to use in their unit designs
that will facilitate transcendent thinking, similar to that driven by the transdisciplinary themes of the PYP
(IB 2012).
In the PYP and MYP the key concepts draw thinking beyond the facts. This is significant for three main
reasons.
1. The use of key concepts prevents an overreliance on memorization of facts as the end goal. In a
concept-based model students must process the facts through their personal intellect—the
conceptual mind. The key concept provides focus to the topic under study, acting as a conceptual
draw for personal engagement and mental processing. The focus shifts from memorization—or a
lower form of mental engagement—to deeper, personal inquiry as students consider connections
between the facts and the key concept(s). Key concepts are macro-concepts that transcend
disciplines such as change, interdependence, system and relationships. The PYP has identified
eight macro-concepts as key concepts to use for the programme. The choice of just one or two
key concepts for a unit planner can prevent the conceptual focus from becoming too diffuse. The
MYP is also working to identify a set of key concepts. Key concepts integrate thinking at the
conceptual level.
2. Key concepts facilitate the transfer of knowledge through time, across cultures and across
situations. The IB position paper Thought, word and deed: The role of cognition, language and
culture in teaching and learning in IB World Schools (Allan 2011) cites research undertaken in
schools in the United States, Australia and Germany that found when students are exposed to
abstract concepts apart from context, learning is difficult.
3. Intercultural understanding depends on the ability to see the commonalities and differences in
terms of concepts and their expressions across global contexts, whether they be social, political,
economic or geographical/environmental. When students develop understanding of key concepts
and central ideas (statements of conceptual relationship) they become aware that these concepts
and ideas can be applied across cultures.
I believe it is critical that all IB programmes attend to both the key concepts and the more discipline-
specific related concepts to ensure that students develop breadth and depth of conceptual
understanding. The transferability of key concepts such as system, change and order help students
recognize the many permutations of each concept from body systems, to economic systems, to
environmental systems. The related concepts, however, ensure that instruction builds depth of
understanding by attending to, and adding to, the language of each subject area—the discipline-specific
concepts and their important relationships from year to year. In the PYP, these related concepts can be
taught in the context of the transdisciplinary units of instruction developed for the programmes of
inquiry. Identifying the related concepts in these units ensures that disciplinary depth is included in the
inquiry. When I use the term “related concepts” in my work with concept-based curriculum design, I am
referring to the concepts related to specific disciplines within the unit, rather than specific concepts
related to various key concepts. The reason for this is I want to identify the more specific concepts to
build disciplinary depth.
At this time the PYP and the MYP ask teachers to use a key concept and a more discipline-specific
related concept to state a central idea and concept statement respectively. To reinforce idea-centred
teaching and conceptual thinking I recommend consideration of additional conceptual understandings
crafted with the more discipline-specific related concepts to be added to each unit. I will call these
understandings “supporting ideas” for the purposes of this discussion. In the MYP and PYP if a year-
long course of instruction was framed under five or six units of instruction, I would think five to eight
supporting ideas per unit—in addition to the central idea/concept statement—would be reasonable to
guide the formative work.
Another reason I suggest that the PYP and MYP use the more specific related concepts to write
additional supporting ideas for their unit planners is to continually build disciplinary schemata in the
brain, so students are prepared for the conceptual rigour of the DP, as well as for lifelong learning and
Concept-based teaching and learning 6

## PAGE 7
work. It is through the conceptual structures of knowledge that the PYP, MYP and DP can be further
aligned and articulated on the IB programme continuum.
Aligning the terminology through the different levels of the IB programmes and articulating central and
supporting ideas using key and related concepts at all three levels of the IB would provide the structure
for a continuous and coherent concept-based scheme of instruction. A concept-based curriculum is
idea-centred. Central and supporting ideas facilitate a pedagogy requiring synergistic thinking which
means guiding students, through inquiry, to realize the deeper conceptual understandings supported by
factual content. In the PYP, a suggestion could be to write more specific disciplinary supporting ideas to
serve as the lines of inquiry. Developing critical central and supporting ideas for the different subject
areas (referred to as “subject groups” in the MYP) across all levels of the IB continuum would provide
clear understanding of targets for the teachers, and would facilitate a truly idea-centred pedagogy. This
would also allow the breadth of curriculum content to be compacted and focused.
How is a concept-based curriculum beneficial to
student learning?
Concept-based curriculum and instruction is essential to the IB educational paradigm. The critical
elements that require a concept-based model are intercultural understanding and international-
mindedness, the ability to transfer knowledge and a rigorous intellectual model that is emotionally
engaging and motivating.
There are many benefits to a concept-based model.
• Thinking—It requires thinking students who draw on critical, creative, reflective and conceptual
thinking abilities.
– Facilitates “synergistic thinking”—the cognitive interplay between the factual and conceptual
levels of thinking.
– Requires deeper intellectual processing as students relate the facts to key concepts and
principles.
– Develops conceptual structures in the brain (brain schemata) to relate new knowledge to
prior knowledge, and to illuminate the patterns and connections of knowledge.
– Facilitates the transfer of knowledge at the conceptual level.
– Provides opportunities for personal meaning-making through processes of thinking, creating
and reflecting.
• Intercultural understanding—It develops intercultural understanding and international-mindedness
through conceptual transfer.
– Facilitates the transfer of learning across global contexts as students engage with concepts
and conceptual understandings as reflected across unique and varied cultures.
– Encourages inquiry into global issues of concern that draw out the multiple perspectives and
situations of different cultures and nations.
• Motivation for learning—It recognizes that intellectual and emotional engagement are essential to
the motivation for learning.
– Increases motivation for learning by inviting students to think about the facts through a
relevant and personally engaging key concept. The unit topic and the key concept have an
iterative relationship—each reinforces the other, for example, considering the facts about
“Global conflicts in the 21st century” through the conceptual lens of perspectives, or
considering facts about “Our land and people” through the lens of identity.
Concept-based teaching and learning 7

## PAGE 8
– Values and respects the thinking of the individual by “drawing understandings from” rather
than “telling understandings to”.
– Encourages constructivist learning experiences that are relevant and important.
– Values collaborative thinking, discussions, and problem-solving with the belief that the social
construction of meaning not only leads to a quality product, but is motivating to participants
as well.
• Fluency with language—It increases fluency with the languages of cultures and the disciplines.
– Illuminates the conceptual structures of “meta-language” to facilitate multilingual learning and
communication across cultures.
– Builds increasing fluency with disciplinary language as students explain and support their
conceptual understanding with relevant factual knowledge.
– Reinforces a common conceptual vocabulary and set of critical conceptual understandings in
the different disciplines which can help alleviate language barriers in global labour contexts
when students enter the workforce.
These benefits are inherently supportive of the majority of the characteristics outlined in the IB learner
profile (IB 2009a, p 5):
• inquirers
• knowledgeable
• thinkers
• communicators
• open-minded
• reflective.
What are the required pedagogical shifts?
Synergistic thinking
I believe that synergistic thinking (Erickson 2007; 2009b) is essential for intellectual development.
Synergistic thinking is a cognitive interplay between the factual and conceptual levels of mental
processing. Synergy can be defined as two interacting agents providing a greater effect than either
agent acting alone. Thinking without this factual/conceptual interaction can be shallow. Without a
deliberate curriculum design that mandates this intellectual interplay, we may confuse memorized
knowledge with deeper understanding. Just knowing the definitions of concepts is not sufficient. Just
knowing facts is not sufficient.
Transfer of knowledge and skills
Facts do not transfer. They are locked in time, place or situation. Knowledge transfers at the conceptual
level as concepts, generalizations and principles are applied across global contexts and situations. The
ability to use the conceptual level of thinking to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge, to see
patterns and connections between different examples of the same concept or conceptual
understanding, and to pattern and sort the expanding information base is a critical skill for the 21st
century. The transfer of processes and skills across multiple disciplines and contexts to deepen
understanding and enhance performance is another mandatory facet of IB programmes. The
approaches to learning (ATL) in the MYP continue to be developed along with the transdisciplinary skills
in the PYP. Work is underway to organize ATL skills across all levels of the IB related to five skill
clusters: social, research, thinking, communication and self-management.
Concept-based teaching and learning 8

## PAGE 9
Social construction of meaning
Quality thinking is hard work. Concept-based models encourage collaborative group work to enhance
thinking and problem-solving. Different minds working together scaffold each other and generate new
ideas and solutions. The social construction of meaning and collaborative groups work is a significant
aspect of all IB programmes. School days filled with teacher-dominated lectures to passive students,
locked into parallel rows of desks, are hopefully a relic of past pedagogies.
Effective concept-based teachers in IB programmes understand the principles of synergistic thinking,
the transfer of knowledge and socially constructed meaning-making. They have at some point made the
following pedagogical shifts in their instruction if they began their teaching career in a traditional two-
dimensional model. (Please also see the appendix for an example.)

Challenges and summary
There are challenges to the development and implementation of a concept-based, three-dimensional
curriculum. But challenges indicate opportunities. The IB has the opportunity to meet the challenges to

## PAGE 10
refine the IB programmes so they are truly the most effective and engaging in the world. The greatest
challenges centre around curriculum development and programme articulation, teacher training and
assessment.
Fundamental to success in meeting each of these challenges is a solid understanding of concept-
based, three-dimensional curriculum and instruction.
1. Curriculum development. Quality teaching is supported by quality curriculums. The curriculum
must be concept-based to meet the goals of transfer of knowledge, deep conceptual
understanding, synergistic thinking, intercultural understanding and personal intellectual
engagement. The IB continuum can be articulated and coordinated through the development of
common terminology and a common curricular framework of key concepts, related concepts, and
central and discipline-based supporting conceptual understandings. Unit planners can help ensure
that a concept-based teaching plan will be developed.
2. Teacher training. This challenge is critical to the success of a concept-based model. If teachers do
not understand the concept-based model and required shifts in pedagogy they will fall back on
traditional teaching methods and fail to effect transfer of knowledge and deep understanding. As
new schools and teachers are continually joining the IB family, creative ways of delivering the
teacher training need to be developed. Regional training centres around the world that certify IB
trainers after a rigorous training programme of one or two weeks with materials that teach the
concept-based model along with the other facets of the IB programmes could be part of the
solution. The critical point is that anyone training teachers on the concept-based model must
understand the model completely and be able to convey that understanding to others effectively.
(Administrators also need to be well trained on the meaning of a concept-based curriculum, what
to look for in instruction and how to support teachers in the implementation of the IB model.)
3. Assessment—The challenge here is to assess to the conceptual level of understanding, rather
than just to the factual level. The design of the classroom assessments must be part of the
teacher training programme. The IB external assessments also need to assess to the conceptual
level of understanding, while allowing schools to use local content to support the understandings.
Many nations lament the academic progress of their students year after year. Government officials
institute “solutions” and throw money at the problem but the “solutions” usually centre around increased
objectives to ensure topics are covered fully and more testing to make certain the curriculum is taught
as defined. However, the focus is on the content rather than on the development of the whole child—
social, emotional, intellectual and physical—a terrible mistake.
The IB is on the correct path to prepare citizens of the future for living, learning and working in global
environments, and for addressing the complex problems and issues that will undoubtedly arise. The IB
community is a family of passionate educators who will continue to develop common understandings in
curriculum and pedagogy to keep the ship on course. This journey could not be more important.

Nevine Safire teaches the MYP. She has developed a concept-based unit around the central question
“When does population growth become ‘overpopulation’?” To focus this unit she has chosen the key
concepts of interactions and change from the MYP subject group guides. She is facilitating inquiry into
the central idea “human/environmental interactions can become unbalanced, leading to changes with
unintended consequences”.
Ms Safire has identified related concepts from science and the humanities to use in developing some
supporting ideas to facilitate greater conceptual depth and understanding throughout the inquiry. Some
of these concepts she found in the MYP subject group guides; others she extrapolated from the content
she will be teaching:

pedagogy through the following:
• checking for prior understanding of concepts
• encouraging predictions
• using different kinds of questions (factual, conceptual, debatable) to move thinking beyond the
facts
• engaging synergistic thinking
• assessing for conceptual understanding as well as facts and skills.
